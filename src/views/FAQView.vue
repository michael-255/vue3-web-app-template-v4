              All of your data is being stored locally on the device and web browser you are using
              this application on. This means you retain control of your data at all times.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, this also means you are responsible for making backups of your data by using
              the export feature in Settings to download it.

              Use the export feature in Settings to download your data. You can email the exported
              data file to yourself so you can access it on the other device.
            </p>

            <p>
              Use the import feature in Settings once you are on your other device. This feature
              allows you to select and load yyour exported data to this device.

              Your best bet is to go to the Settings page and access the Logs data. You can view
              most errors and other events that occur in the application from there.
